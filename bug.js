This error occurs when you try to access a component's state or props before it has fully mounted.  This commonly happens when you attempt to use `this.state` or `this.props` within the `constructor` before `super(props)` is called, or within methods called before the component has finished rendering.

```javascript
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    // Incorrect: Accessing props before super(props) is called
    console.log(this.props.someProp); 
    super(props);
    this.state = { count: 0 };
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        <Text>{this.state.count}</Text>
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```
